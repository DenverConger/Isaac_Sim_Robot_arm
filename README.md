# Overview

This is my Crazy Project where I work on building a robot arm and getting it to be smsrt. I am using Ros2 with Isaac Sim and Pytorch for Reinforcement learning

So far I have worked on the physical robot and Getting the Digital Twin in my Issac Sim with basic ROS2 Modularity and actuation

I have really just wanted to do this project for a long time and decided that my knowlege level should be good enough now to tackle this!
